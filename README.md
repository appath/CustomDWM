A simplified view of installing a window manager.

**Note**: decided to write a simple script (in **Python3**) to install the window manager **DWM**.
```
  Scripts
      StatusBAR - panel with main icons located at the bottom of the screen.
      List:
          battery - the laptop battery can provide information, displays information in the 
          StatusBAR in the form of an icon . .
          [[ in the process(script) ]]
          
          clock -
          memory -
          keyboard layout -
          ///
```
