A simplified view of installing a window manager.

**Note**: decided to write a simple script (in **Python3**) to install the window manager **DWM**.
```
  Scripts
      StatusBAR - panel with main icons located at the bottom of the screen.
      List:
          clock -
          memory -
          keyboard layout -
          ///
```

Install package: [CustomDWM Ubuntu Linux](https://github.com/appath/CustomDWM/releases)
